	**Reference Dataset:**

	**Project Background:** 
Olist is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. You can find more information about Olist by visiting their website: www.olist.com.

	**Project Scope:** 
This project aims to focus more on geospatial analysis techniques such as spatial clustering of geographically reference attributes techniques in particular. 

	** Conditions:	**  
1. **Geographical scope:**  The study area will be confined to customers located within the extended metropolitan of Sao Paulo city, the state capital of Sao Paulo State and also an alpha global city (as listed by the GaWC). It is also the most populous city in Brazil, the Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere as well as being the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. This extended metropolitan area is officially called Região Metropolitana de São Paulo (RMSP) in Portuguese. In terms of the geographical unit, the level 3 administrative boundary (i.e. district) level should be used. The administrative boundary GIS file of Brazil are downloadable from either the Humanitarian Data Exchange HDX portal or GADM portal.
2. **Time scope:**  The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. This project will mainly focus on transactions occurred in 2017. This is because the transactions done in 2016 were relatively sparse and the transactions in 2018 are only complete until August 2018. In terms of time frame, the project will focus on annual level.
3. **Attributes scope:** There are many useful measures that can be derived from the data sets. In view of time limitation, this projet will focus on five key measures, namely total number of transactions, total sales values, total freight values, average sales per transaction and average freight per transaction.
